        <div class="panel-body"> A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction of programming concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions. Two good examples of low-level languages are assembly and machine code.</div>

        <div class="panel-body">Low level languages are those that take many times more instructions than do C, Java, Fortran, etc. The best examples are assembly languages, such as IBM 360 assembler, PDP-10 assembler, Intel x86 assembler, etc. Name any computer and it will have a low-level assembler language unique to that computer.</div>

        <div class="panel-body">A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.
        A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.</div>

        <div class="panel-body">Ultimately, programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter. The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s. Now there are dozens of different languages, including Ada, Algol, BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Pascal, and Prolog.</div>

        <div class="panel-body">The main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain.
